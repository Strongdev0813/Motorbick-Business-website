## Description <a name="Description"></a>

 Company E-commerce site project. We made it in a group of three people in a few days.


 We worked on React with the route method and used a bunch of libraries like 
 
 Formik, Redux, Yup, Mui, Bootstrap, and more.
 
  You are welcome to register with our club, book a test drive and even "purchase" a 
  motorbike. 

The website is responsive.

Appreciate constructive criticism.
